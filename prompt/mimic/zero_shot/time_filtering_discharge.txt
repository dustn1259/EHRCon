Task Overview:
You are provided with a Discharge summary and are required to analyze time information related to an entity mentioned within the note. 

Let's solve three questions that focus on {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}}.
<<<<NOTE_TYPE>>>> note:
    - Date of Note: <<<CHARTTIME>>> (Today)
    - Admission Date: <<<ADMISSION>>>
    - Content: "<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>"

[Question 1] Based on the clinical note provided, did the measurement for {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} occur during the current hospitalization period? Respond with 'Yes' if it did, or 'No' if it pertains to past medical history or conditions.

Format your response as follows:
[Answer 2] 
Note: [Write the answer here]
Time: [Write the answer here]

[Question 3] Determine how the time of the {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} measurement is recorded in the note. elect the appropriate option based on the description provided answer from Question2:
1. Indeterminate Time stamp: Select this option when the note mentions the event in a broad or unspecific timeframe without concrete dates or times. Examples include phrases like "during the physical exam" or "while in the hospital", which do not provide precise temporal information.
2. Directly written in the format yyyy-mm-dd: This choice is appropriate for notes that contain specific dates or times in a clear, numerical format. It applies when the note includes the year, month, day, and possibly the time, all in numbers. Formats such as '2000-11-11', '2130-11-10 10:00:00', or '11-13' are examples. Opt for this option only if the note unambiguously displays the date and time in this numerical fashion.
3. Inferable Time stamp from Narrative: Select this option if the note contains terms or phrases that help infer the exact timing of an event through provided context. Words like 'admission', 'yesterday', or 'three days post-operation', even without direct numerical dates or times, make it possible to deduce when the event occurred in relation to a specific term such as 'admission'. It's essential that there be a contextually anchored time-related term or phrase (e.g., 'admission') to guide this deduction.
Remember, Only provide the descriptor name as the answer without any additional explanation.
