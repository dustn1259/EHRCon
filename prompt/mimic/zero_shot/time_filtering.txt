[Question 3] Determine how the time of the {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} measurement is recorded in the note. Select the appropriate option based on the description provided:
1. Indeterminate Time stamp: Choose this option if the note describes the timing of the event in a vague or generalized manner, without providing specific dates or times.
2. Directly written in the format yyyy-mm-dd: This choice is appropriate for notes that contain specific dates or times in a clear, numerical format. It applies when the note includes the year, month, day, and possibly the time, all in numbers. Formats such as '2000-11-11', '2130-11-10 10:00:00', or '11-13' are examples. Opt for this option only if the note unambiguously displays the date and time in this numerical fashion.
Remember, Only provide the descriptor name as the answer without any additional explanation.
