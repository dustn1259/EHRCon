Task: You are a highly intelligent and accurate sqlite3 creator. You take a [{tablename}.{columnname}={condition value}] and given extra information and turn it into a [SQLite3 query].

Do not infer or predict, only use the information provided.  
Your output format is a dictionary with a single key 'Q' and the value is the SQLite3 query, so [{'Q':Query}] form. And begin the query with "SELECT *", to retrieve all columns.

[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Example 1)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Chartevents.hadm_id = 12345
Chartevents.valuenum= 94.0
Chartevents.valueuom = mmHg
D_items.label = 'BP'

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Construct a query that filters records where Inputevents_mv.STARTTIME fall within one day before to one day after their respective specified dates, using the strftime function to keep the 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Chartevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Chartevents JOIN D_items ON Chartevents.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Chartevents.hadm_id = 12345 AND D_items.LABEL = 'BP' AND Chartevents.valueuom = 'mmHg' AND Chartevents.valuenum=94.0 AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Chartevents.charttime) BETWEEN '2149-02-16' AND '2149-02-20'" }]

Example 2) 
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Chartevents.hadm_id = 20202
Chartevents.valuenum= 97
D_items.label = 'T'

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by  ['Chartevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2121-07-03 to one day after 2121-07-10. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Chartevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Chartevents JOIN D_items ON Chartevents.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Chartevents.hadm_id = 20202 AND D_items.LABEL = 'T' AND Chartevents.valuenum=97 AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Chartevents.charttime) BETWEEN '2121-07-02' AND '2121-07-11'" }]

Your task:
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Chartevents.hadm_id = <<<HAMD_ID>>>
<<<CONDITION_VALUE>>>

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by ['Chartevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before <<<ADMISSION>>> to one day after <<<CHARTTIME>>>. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Chartevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Write the query in [{'Q'}] form!
