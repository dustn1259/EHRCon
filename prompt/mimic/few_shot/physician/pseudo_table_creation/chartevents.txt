Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. CHARTTIME: charttime, VALUENUM: valuenum, VALUEUOM: valueuom'

Additional Requirement:
1. For instances like 'BP 120/70', treat it as two separate mentions of the entity BPâ€”once for the systolic measurement (120) and once for the diastolic measurement (70). Each measurement should be recorded individually in the VALUENUM column without combining them as '120/70'.
2. When the clinical note specifies a range for a measurement (for example, 'entity 120-130'), it indicates that the measurement can fall anywhere within that range. For these instances, you should skip documenting this information entirely in the table; do not fill in any value for VALUENUM, and do not create a table row for this range. Simply proceed as if the range mention does not provide a specific enough detail to be included.

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. Charttime: Charttime records the time at which an observation occurred and is usually the closest proxy to the time the data was measured, such as admission time or a specific date like 2112-12-12.
    - Datatype: <class 'datetime'>
2. VALUENUM: This column contains the numerical value of the laboratory test result, offering a quantifiable measure of the test outcome. If this data is not numeric, Valuenum must be null.
    - Datatype:  <class 'float'>
3. VALUEUOM: Valueuom is the unit of measurement.
    - Datatype: <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the nursing note to extract {{**BP**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Physician note:
"Flowsheet Data as of  [**2144-05-21**] 08:42 AM
Vital signs
Hemodynamic monitoring
Fluid balance
         24 hours
           Since 12 AM
Tmax: 37.5 (36-38)
C (99.5
T current: 37
C (98.6
HR: 65 (58 - 82) bpm
{**BP**}}: 125/72(85) {103/55(67) - 125/82(91)} mmHg
RR: 14 (10 - 22) insp/min
SPO2: 100%
Heart rhythm: SR (Sinus Rhythm)
Total In:
6,460 mL"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**BP**}}' in the given text.**
[Answer in step 1]: {{**BP**}}: 125/72(85) {103/55(67) - 125/82(91)} mmHg

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**BP**}}' occurs. **
[Answer in step 2]: BP is considered to be the information at the time the note was written, so it can be thought that they occurred at the charttime.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**BP**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**BP**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM. If specific details are not mentioned in the physician note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: The systolic value was 125, and the diastolic value was 72 and mean is 85. As referenced in Step 2, the charttime for blood pressure is at [**2144-05-21**] 08:42 AM.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**BP**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**blood pressure**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME:  [**2144-05-21**] 08:42 AM, VALUENUM: 125, VALUEUOM: mmHg"
- "Mentioned [2]. CHARTTIME:  [**2144-05-21**] 08:42 AM, VALUENUM: 72, VALUEUOM: mmHg"
- "Mentioned [3]. CHARTTIME:  [**2144-05-21**] 08:42 AM, VALUENUM: 85, VALUEUOM: mmHg"

Example 2: Analyze the nursing note to extract {{**Tmax**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Physician note:
"Flowsheet Data as of  [**2144-05-21**] 08:42 AM
Vital signs
Hemodynamic monitoring
Fluid balance
         24 hours
           Since 12 AM
{{**Tmax**}}: 37.5 (36-38)
C (99.5
T current: 37
C (98.6
HR: 65 (58 - 82) bpm
BP: 125/72(85) {103/55(67) - 125/82(91)} mmHg
RR: 14 (10 - 22) insp/min
SPO2: 100%
Heart rhythm: SR (Sinus Rhythm)
Total In:
6,460 mL"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Tmax**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: {{**Tmax**}}: 37.5 C (99.5

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Tmax**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: Tmax is considered to be the information at the time the note was written, so it can be thought that they occurred at the charttime.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Tmax**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Tmax**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM. If specific details are not mentioned in the physician note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: In the physician note mentioning '{{Tmax}}', we determined that the values for Tmax were 37.5 and 99.5, respectively. The unit of measurement for 37.5 is 'C' , but the note does not specify the unit for 99.5, rendering its unit as NaN. As noted in Step 2, the chart time for these observations is recorded as 'charttime'.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present our Findings Directly Related to '{{**Tmax**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Tmax**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: charttime , VALUENUM: 37.5 , VALUEUOM: c "
- "Mentioned [2]. CHARTTIME: charttime , VALUENUM: 99.5 , VALUEUOM: NAN "

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.
