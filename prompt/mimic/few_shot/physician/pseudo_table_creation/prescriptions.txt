Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. DRUG: drug, STARTDATE: startdate, ENDDATE: enddate, DOSE_VAL_RX: dose_val_rx, DOSE_UNIT_RX: dose_unit_rx'

Additional Requirements:
1. When the clinical note specifies a range for a measurement (for example, 'entity 1 to 2 p.o'), it indicates that the measurement can fall anywhere within that range. For these instances, you should skip documenting this information entirely in the table; do not fill in any value for DOSE_VAL_RX, and do not create a table row for this range. Simply proceed as if the range mention does not provide a specific enough detail to be included.

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. DRUG: The Drug column lists the name of the medication that was prescribed to the patient.
    - Datatype: <class 'str'>
2. STARTDATE: The Startdate column records the date when a prescribed medication was first ordered or administered to the patient.
    - Datatype:  <class 'datetime'>
3. ENDDATE: The Enddate column records the date when the administration of a prescribed medication was completed or discontinued.
    - Datatype: <class 'datetime'>
4. DOSE_VAL_RX: The Dose_val_rx column specifies the numeric value of the prescribed dose for the medication.
    - Datatype:  <class 'float'>
5. DOSE_UNIT_RX: The Dose_unit_rx column specifies the unit of measurement for the prescribed dose of the medication, such as milligrams (mg) or milliliters (mL).
    - Datatype:  <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the physician note to extract {{**Vancomycin**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Physician note: 
"Last dose of Antibiotics:
Ceftriaxone - [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM
{{**Vancomycin**}} - [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM
Ciprofloxacin - [**2149-1-30**] 03:00 AM
Metronidazole - [**2149-1-30**] 04:00 AM"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Vancomycin**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: Last dose of Antibiotics: ...  {{**Vancomycin**}} - [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM

**Step 2) Determine the STARTDATE and ENDDATE step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Vancomycin**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: Vancomycin treated at the [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM so Startdate would be [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM and enddate would be NaN.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Vancomycin**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{** **}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: DRUG, STARTDATE, ENDDATE, DOSE_VAL_RX, DOSE_UNIT_RX. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: As referred to in the answer from step 2, the drug is Vancomycin. The starttime should be at [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM, and the endtime would be NaN. The valuenum should be NaN, and the dose_val_rx should be in NaN.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Vancomycin**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Vancomycin**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. DRUG: Vancomycin, STARTDATE: [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM, ENDDATE: NaN, DOSE_VAL_RX: NaN, DOSE_UNIT_RX: NaN"

Example 2: Analyze the physician note to extract {{**Lasix**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Physician note: 
"The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
with a notable episode of myocardial infarction in 2020. 
Recently, they were administered 160 mg of {{**Lasix**}} intravenously for fluid overload.
Assessment:  vital signs were recorded with a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg, 
heart rate at 82 bpm, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 98.7Â°F."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: She presented to the catheterization laboratory area and was talking and then had acute severe pulmonary edema and was intubated in the catheterization laboratory, started on a nitro drip, and given 160 mg of {{**Lasix**}} IV on admission.

**Step 2) Determine the STARTDATE and ENDDATE step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Lasix**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: I cannot know STARTDATE and ENDDATE because it is past information.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: DRUG, STARTDATE, ENDDATE, DOSE_VAL_RX, DOSE_UNIT_RX. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: The drug is Lasix, with 'dose_val_rx' being 160 and 'dose_unit_rx' being mg. According to the answer in step 2, both startdate and enddate would be NaN.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. DRUG: Lasix, STARTDATE: NaN, ENDDATE: NaN, DOSE_VAL_RX: 160, DOSE_UNIT_RX: mg"

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.
