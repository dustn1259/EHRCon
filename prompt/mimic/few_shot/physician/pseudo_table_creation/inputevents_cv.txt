Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. CHARTTIME: charttime, AMOUNT: amount, AMOUNTUOM: amountuom, RATE: rate, RATEUOM: rateuom'

Additional Requirement:
1. When the clinical note specifies a range for a measurement (for example, 'entity 120-130'), it indicates that the measurement can fall anywhere within that range. For these instances, you should skip documenting this information entirely in the table; do not fill in any value for AMOUNT or RATE, and do not create a table row for this range. Simply proceed as if the range mention does not provide a specific enough detail to be included.

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. CHARTTIME: Charttime represents the time at which the measurement was charted
    - Datatype: <class 'datetime'>
2. AMOUNT: Indicates the total quantity of the input given during the charted event.
    - Datatype: <class 'float'>
3. AMOUNTUOM: Amountuom is the unit of Amount.
    - Datatype: <class 'str'>
4. RATE: Details the rate at which the input was administered, typically relevant for intravenous fluids or medications.
    -  Datatype: <class 'float'>
5. RATEUOM: Rateuom is the unit of Rate.
    -  Datatype: <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the physician note to extract {{**0.9% Normal Saline IV**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Physician note:
"A 66-year-old male with a history of distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for IPMN presented 
with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and altered mental status. Elevated troponin levels and ST 
elevations were found, but cardiac catheterization showed no coronary lesions and suggested
global hypokinesis, indicative of myocarditis. The patient also exhibited leukocytosis and acute 
renal failure, pointing towards systemic inflammation or infection. He received an initial 1 liter
bolus of {{**0.9% Normal Saline**}} IV for fluid resuscitation due to dehydration and potential sepsis.
Management involved consultations from cardiology, nephrology, and infectious disease 
to address the complex interplay of symptoms."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**0.9% Normal Saline**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: He received an initial 1 liter bolus of {{**0.9% Normal Saline**}} IV for fluid resuscitation

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**0.9% Normal Saline**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: ASince no specific time is explicitly mentioned, it can be assumed that the blood pressure event occurred at the charttime.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**0.9% Normal Saline**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**0.9% Normal Saline**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, AMOUNT, AMOUNTUOM, RATE, RATEUOM. If specific details are not mentioned in the physician note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: As referred to in the answer from step 2, charttime should be at charttime. The amount should be 1, and the amoutuom should be in liter. However, The rate should be NaN, and the rateuom should be in NaN.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**0.9% Normal Saline**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**0.9% Normal Saline**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: charttime, AMOUNT: 1, AMOUNTUOM: liter, RATE: NaN, RATEUOM: NaN"

Example 2: Analyze the physician note to extract {{**Ceftriaxone**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.
 
Physician note:
"Last dose of Antibiotics:
{{**Ceftriaxone**}} - [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM
Vancomycin - [**2149-1-30**] 12:00 AM
Ciprofloxacin - [**2149-1-30**] 03:00 AM
Metronidazole - [**2149-1-30**] 04:00 AM"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Ceftriaxone**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: {{**Ceftriaxone**}} - [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Ceftriaxone**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: Considering that Ceftriaxone was successfully administered on [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM, the charttime for this event would be [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Ceftriaxone**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Ceftriaxone**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, AMOUNT, AMOUNTUOM, RATE, RATEUOM. If specific details are not mentioned in the physician note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Given the outcome from Step 2, it's understood that the chart time was marked as [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM. However, both the amount and rate should be recorded as NaN (not a number), and similarly, the units of measurement for both amount (amountuom) and rate (rateuom) should also be noted as NaN.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Ceftriaxone**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Ceftriaxone**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: [**2149-1-29**] 01:00 AM, AMOUNT: NaN, AMOUNTUOM: NaN, RATE: NaN, RATEUOM: NaN"
