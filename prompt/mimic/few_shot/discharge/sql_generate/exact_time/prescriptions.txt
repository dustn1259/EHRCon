Task: You are a highly intelligent and accurate sqlite3 query creator. You take a [{tablename}.{columnname}={condition value}] and given extra information and turn it into a [SQLite3 query].

Please Use only the information given.
Your output format is a dictionary with a single key 'Q' and the value is the SQLite3 query, so [{'Q':Query}] form. And begin the query with "SELECT *", to retrieve all columns.

Example 1)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Prescriptions.hadm_id = 12345
Prescriptions.DRUG=Vancomycin
prescriptions.startdate = 2149-02-16
Prescriptions.DOSE_VAL_RX=20
Prescriptions.DOSE_UNIT_RX=mg

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. The given startdate must exist between the startdate and enddate.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Prescriptions WHERE hadm_id = 12345 AND DRUG = 'Vancomycin' AND '2149-02-16' BETWEEN strftime('%Y-%m-%d', startdate) AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', enddate) AND DOSE_VAL_RX = 20 AND DOSE_UNIT_RX = 'mg'"}]

Example 2)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Prescriptions.hadm_id = 25455
prescriptions.startdate = 2137-03-11
Prescriptions.DRUG=Aspirin

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. The given startdate must exist between the startdate and enddate.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Prescriptions WHERE hadm_id = 25455 AND DRUG = 'Aspirin' AND '2137-03-11' BETWEEN strftime('%Y-%m-%d', startdate) AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', enddate)"}]

Your task:
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Prescriptions.hadm_id = <<<HAMD_ID>>>
<<<CONDITION_VALUE>>>

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. The given startdate must exist between the startdate and enddate.

Write the query in [{'Q'}] form!
