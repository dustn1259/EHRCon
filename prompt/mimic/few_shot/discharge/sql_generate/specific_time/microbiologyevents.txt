Task: You are a highly intelligent and accurate sqlite3 query creator. You take a [{tablename}.{columnname}={condition value}] and given extra information and turn it into a [SQLite3 query].

Please Use only the information given.
Your output format is a dictionary with a single key 'Q' and the value is the SQLite3 query, so [{'Q':Query}] form. And begin the query with "SELECT *", to retrieve all columns.

Example 1)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 10304
Microbiologyevents.charttime = 2149-02-16
Microbiologyevents.spec_type_desc: sputum
Microbiologyevents.org_name = Pseudomonas

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime to maintain the given time format.
2. Construct a query that filters records where Microbiologyevents.charttime fall within one day before to one day after their respective specified dates, using the strftime function to keep the 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. 'Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid' and 'Microbiologyevents.org_itemid' need to be joined individually with the 'D_items.itemid' table, using them as the keys for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Microbiologyevents JOIN D_items AS D1 ON Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid = D1.itemid JOIN D_items AS D2 ON Microbiologyevents.org_itemid = D2.itemid WHERE Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 10304 AND Microbiologyevents.spec_type_desc = 'sputum' AND Microbiologyevents.charttime BETWEEN strftime('%Y-%m-%d', '2149-02-16', '-1 day') AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', '2149-02-16', '+1 day')"}]

Example 2) 
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 20202
Microbiologyevents.charttime = 2121-07-03
Microbiologyevents.org_name= ESCHERICHIA COLI

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime to maintain the given time format.
2. Construct a query that filters records where Microbiologyevents.charttime fall within one day before to one day after their respective specified dates, using the strftime function to keep the 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. 'Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid' and 'Microbiologyevents.org_itemid' need to be joined individually with the 'D_items.itemid' table, using them as the keys for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Microbiologyevents JOIN D_items ON Microbiologyevents.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 20202 AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Microbiologyevents.charttime) BETWEEN strftime('%Y-%m-%d', '2121-07-03', '-1 day') AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', '2121-07-03', '+1 day') AND Microbiologyevents.org_name = 'ESCHERICHIA COLI'"}]

Your task:
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = <<<HAMD_ID>>>
<<<CONDITION_VALUE>>>

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime to maintain the given time format.
2. Construct a query that filters records where Microbiologyevents.charttime fall within one day before to one day after their respective specified dates, using the strftime function to keep the 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Microbiologyevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Write the query in [{'Q'}] form!
