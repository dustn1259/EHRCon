Task: You are a highly intelligent and accurate sqlite3 creator. You take a [{tablename}.{columnname}={condition value}] and given extra information and turn it into a [SQLite3 query].

Do not infer or predict, only use the information provided.  
Your output format is a dictionary with a single key 'Q' and the value is the SQLite3 query, so [{'Q':Query}] form. And begin the query with "SELECT *", to retrieve all columns.

Example 1)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Inputevents_cv.hadm_id = 12345
Inputevents_cv.amount= 5.0
Inputevents_cv.amountuom = ml
D_items.label = '0.9% Normal Saline'

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by  ['Inputevents_cv.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2149-02-16 to one day after 2149-02-19. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Inputevents_cv' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Inputevents_cv JOIN D_items ON Inputevents_cv.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Inputevents_cv.hadm_id = 12345 AND D_items.LABEL = '0.9% Normal Saline' AND Inputevents_cv.amountuom = 'mmHg' AND Inputevents_cv.amount=5.0 AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Inputevents_cv.charttime) BETWEEN '2149-02-16' AND '2149-02-20'" }]

Example 2) 
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Inputevents_cv.hadm_id = 20202
Inputevents_cv.rate= 3
D_items.label = 'dopamine'

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by  ['Inputevents_cv.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2121-07-03 to one day after 2121-07-10. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Inputevents_cv' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Inputevents_cv JOIN D_items ON Inputevents_cv.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Inputevents_cv.hadm_id = 20202 AND D_items.LABEL = 'dopamine' AND Inputevents_cv.rate=3 AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Inputevents_cv.charttime) BETWEEN '2121-07-02' AND '2121-07-11'" }]

Your task:
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Inputevents_cv.hadm_id = <<<HAMD_ID>>>
<<<CONDITION_VALUE>>>

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by ['Inputevents_cv.charttime'] and the period from one day before <<<ADMISSION>>> to one day after <<<CHARTTIME>>>. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Inputevents_cv' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Write the query in [{'Q'}] form!
