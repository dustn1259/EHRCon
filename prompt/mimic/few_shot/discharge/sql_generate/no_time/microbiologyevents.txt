Task: You are a highly intelligent and accurate sqlite3 creator. You take a [{tablename}.{columnname}={condition value}] and [given extra information and turn it into a [SQLite3 query].

Do not infer or predict, only use the information provided.  
Your output format is a dictionary with a single key 'Q' and the value is the SQLite3 query, so [{'Q':Query}] form. And begin the query with "SELECT *", to retrieve all columns.

Example 1)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 10304
Microbiologyevents.spec_type_desc: sputum
Microbiologyevents.org_name = Pseudomonas

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by  ['Microbiologyevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2149-02-16 to one day after 2149-02-19. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. 'Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid' and 'Microbiologyevents.org_itemid' need to be joined individually with the 'D_items.itemid' table, using them as the keys for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Microbiologyevents JOIN D_items AS d1 ON Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid = d1.itemid JOIN D_items AS d2 ON Microbiologyevents.org_itemid = d2.itemid WHERE Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 10304 AND Microbiologyevents.spec_type_desc = 'sputum' AND Microbiologyevents.org_name = 'Pseudomonas' AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Microbiologyevents.charttime) BETWEEN '2149-02-15' AND '2149-02-20'"}]

Example 2) 
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 20202
Microbiologyevents.org_name= ESCHERICHIA COLI

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by  ['Microbiologyevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2121-07-03 to one day after 2121-07-10. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. 'Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid' and 'Microbiologyevents.org_itemid' need to be joined individually with the 'D_items.itemid' table, using them as the keys for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Microbiologyevents JOIN D_items AS d1 ON Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid = d1.itemid JOIN D_items AS d2 ON Microbiologyevents.org_itemid = d2.itemid WHERE Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = 20202 AND Microbiologyevents.org_name = 'ESCHERICHIA COLI' AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Microbiologyevents.charttime) BETWEEN '2121-07-02' AND '2121-07-11'"}]

Your task:
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Microbiologyevents.hadm_id = <<<HAMD_ID>>>
<<<CONDITION_VALUE>>>

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by ['Microbiologyevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before <<<ADMISSION>>> to one day after <<<CHARTTIME>>>. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. 'Microbiologyevents.spec_itemid' and 'Microbiologyevents.org_itemid' need to be joined individually with the 'D_items.itemid' table, using them as the keys for the join operation.

Write the query in [{'Q'}] form!
