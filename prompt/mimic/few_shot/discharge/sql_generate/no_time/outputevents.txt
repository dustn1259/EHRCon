Task: You are a highly intelligent and accurate sqlite3 creator. You take a [{tablename}.{columnname}={condition value}] and [given extra information and turn it into a [SQLite3 query].

Do not infer or predict, only use the information provided.  
Your output format is a dictionary with a single key 'Q' and the value is the SQLite3 query, so [{'Q':Query}] form. And begin the query with "SELECT *", to retrieve all columns.

Example 1)
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Outputevents.hadm_id = 12345
Outputevents.valuenum= 500
Outputevents.valueuom = cc
D_items.label = 'Chest tube'

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by ['Outputevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2149-02-16 to one day after 2149-02-19. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Outputevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Outputevents JOIN D_items ON Outputevents.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Outputevents.hadm_id = 12345 AND D_items.LABEL = 'Chest tube' AND Outputevents.valuenum = 'cc' AND Outputevents.valuenum=500 AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Outputevents.charttime) BETWEEN '2149-02-16' AND '2149-02-20'" }]

Example 2) 
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Outputevents.hadm_id = 20202
D_items.label = 'urine'

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by ['Outputevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before 2121-07-03 to one day after 2121-07-10. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Outputevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Output: [{'Q': "SELECT * FROM Outputevents JOIN D_items ON Outputevents.itemid = D_items.itemid WHERE Outputevents.hadm_id = 20202 AND D_items.LABEL = 'urine' AND strftime('%Y-%m-%d', Outputevents.charttime) BETWEEN '2121-07-02' AND '2121-07-11'" }]

Your task:
[{table}.{column}={condition value}]
Outputevents.hadm_id = <<<HAMD_ID>>>
<<<CONDITION_VALUE>>>

[given extra information]
1. Utilize strftime function.
2. Ensure that there is any overlap between the period defined by ['Outputevents.charttime'] and the period from one day before <<<ADMISSION>>> to one day after <<<CHARTTIME>>>. And maintain 'yyyy-mm-dd' format. 
3. The 'Outputevents' and 'D_items' tables need to be joined using the 'itemid' as the key for the join operation.

Write the query in [{'Q'}] form!
