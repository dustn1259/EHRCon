Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. CHARTTIME: charttime, VALUENUM: valuenum, VALUEUOM: valueuom'

Additional Requirement:
1. When the clinical note specifies a range for a measurement (for example, 'entity 120-130'), it indicates that the measurement can fall anywhere within that range. For these instances, you should skip documenting this information entirely in the table; do not fill in any value for VALUENUM, and do not create a table row for this range. Simply proceed as if the range mention does not provide a specific enough detail to be included.

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. Charttime: Charttime records the timestamp when an output event, such as urine output or drainage, was documented. 
    - Datatype: <class 'datetime'>
2. VALUENUM: Valuenum contains the numeric value representing the quantity of output, such as the volume of urine or other fluids, recorded as a floating-point number.
    - Datatype:  <class 'float'>
3. VALUEUOM: Valueuom specifies the unit of measurement for the numeric value recorded in the Valuenum column, such as milliliters (mL).
    - Datatype:  <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**Chest tube**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table. When Extract data, do not make assumptions or infer details not directly stated in the clinical note, even if this is common knowledge.

Clinical note:
"The patient underwent surgery [**2175-7-15**].  
Postoperative day #1 the patient was afebrile with heart rate
of 56, blood pressure 104/56, satting at 99%.  {{**Chest tube**}}
output 500 cc.  Last gas 7.33, 56, 152, 31 and 100%." 

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Chest tube**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: Postoperative day #1 the patient was afebrile with heart rate of 56, blood pressure 104/56, satting at 99%.  {{**Chest tube**}} output 500 cc.

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Chest tube**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The event took place on Postoperative Day #1, so chartime would be Postoperative Day #1.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Chest tube**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Chest tube**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Based on the information provided in step 2, the charttime for the chest tube output should be recorded as Postoperative Day #1. The recorded valuenum for the chest tube output is 500, and the valueuom is cc.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Chest tube**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Chest tube**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: Postoperative Day #1, VALUENUM: 500, VALUEUOM: cc"

Example 2: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**urine**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table. When Extract data, do not make assumptions or infer details not directly stated in the clinical note, even if this is common knowledge.

Clinical note:
"On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred
back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal
sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was
continued with a Lasix drip with good {{**urine**}} output and
improvement of renal function."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**urine**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: He ... continued with a Lasix drip with good {{**urine**}} output and improvement of renal function.

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**urine**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: Based on the given clinical note, it can be inferred that a urine test occurred on [**2125-02-13**]. Therefore, the charttime would be [**2125-02-13**].

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**urine**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**urine**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, VALUENUM, VALUEUOM. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Considering the response from Step 2, the charttime would be [**2125-02-13**], and both the valuenum and valueuom would be NaN. 

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**urine**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**urine**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: [**2125-02-13**], VALUENUM: NaN, VALUEUOM: NaN"

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical note:
