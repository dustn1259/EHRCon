Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. CHARTTIME: charttime, ORG_NAME: org_name, SPEC_TYPE_DESC: spec_type_desc'

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. Charttime: The Charttime column records the timestamp when the microbiological culture result was documented or charted.
    - Datatype: <class 'datetime'>
2. ORG_NAME: The Org_name column identifies the name of the organism (such as a bacterium or fungus) that was detected in a microbiological culture.
    - Datatype:  <class 'str'>
3. SPEC_TYPE_DESC: The Spec_type_desc column describes the type of specimen (such as blood, urine, or tissue) from which the microbiological culture was obtained.
    - Datatype:  <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**Pseudomonas**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table. When Extract data, do not make assumptions or infer details not directly stated in the clinical note, even if this is common knowledge.

Clincial note:
"3. Fever/infectious disease:  The patient has a history of
recurrent line and wound infections.  The patient's sputum
grew Serratia and {{**Pseudomonas**}} sensitive to meropenem and
tobramycin respectively."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Pseudomonas**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: The patient's sputum grew Serratia and {{**Pseudomonas**}} sensitive to meropenem and tobramycin respectively.

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Pseudomonas**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The exact time when it occurred is not specified in the clinical note. Therefore, the charttime would be NaN.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Pseudomonas**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Pseudomonas**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, ORG_NAME, SPEC_TYPE_DESC. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Considering the response from Step 2, the 'charttime' value would be 'NaN'. According to the clinical note, 'ORG_NAME' should be 'Pseudomonas,' and 'SPEC_TYPE_DESC' should be 'sputum'.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Pseudomonas**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Pseudomonas**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: NaN, ORG_NAME: Pseudomonas, SPEC_TYPE_DESC: sputum"

Example 2: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table. When Extract data, do not make assumptions or infer details not directly stated in the clinical note, even if this is common knowledge.

Clinical note:
"FLUID CULTURE (Final [** On Hospital Day 2**]):
      {{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}. Resistant to all organisms except E Coli"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: FLUID CULTURE (Final [** On Hospital Day 2**]): {{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}. Resistant to all organisms except E Coli

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The test was conducted on Hospital Day 2, so the charttime for the 'ESCHERICHIA COLI' result would be Hospital Day 2.

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**STAPH AUREUS COAG +**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: CHARTTIME, ORG_NAME, SPEC_TYPE_DESC. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Considering the response from Step 2, the 'charttime' value would be 'Hospital Day 2'. According to the clinical note, 'ORG_NAME' should be 'ESCHERICHIA COLI' and 'SPEC_TYPE_DESC' should be 'FLUID CULTURE'.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**ESCHERICHIA COLI**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. CHARTTIME: Hospital Day 2, ORG_NAME: ESCHERICHIA COLI, SPEC_TYPE_DESC: FLUID CULTURE"

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical note:
"<<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>>"
