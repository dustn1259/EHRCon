Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. SHORT_TITLE: short_title, LONG_TITLE: long_title'

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. SHORT_TITLE: Short_title provides brief descriptions or names of medical diagnoses corresponding to their ICD-9 codes.
    - Datatype: <class 'str'>
2. LONG_TITLE: Long_title offers more detailed descriptions of medical diagnoses corresponding to their ICD-9 codes.
    - Datatype:  <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical Note:
"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal varices s/p banding.
2.  Portal gastropathy.
3.  Gastritis esophagitis.
4.  {{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis.**}}
5.  Coronary disease.
6.  Recurrent deep venous thrombosis.
7.  Congestive heart failure.
8.  Diabetes.
9.  s/p abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
10.  Seizure disorder.
"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: ... Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis.

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: During hospitalization

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: SHORT_TITLE, LONG_TITLE. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Long title would be Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis and Short title would be Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. SHORT_TITLE: Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis, SHORT_TITLE: Hemachromatosis with early cirrhosis"

Example 2: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical Note:
"DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  {{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis.**}}
2.  Cholecystitis.
3.  Class B cirrhosis."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  {{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis.**}}

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: During hospitalization

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: SHORT_TITLE, LONG_TITLE. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: Short title would be Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis and Long title would be Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. SHORT_TITLE: Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis, LONG_TITLE: Urinary tract infection complicated by sepsis"

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical note:
"<<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>>"
