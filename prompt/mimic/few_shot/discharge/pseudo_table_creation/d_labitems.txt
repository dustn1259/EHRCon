Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. LABEL: label'

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. LABEL: The label column provides a human-readable name for this item. The label could be a description of a clinical observation such as wbc, glucose, and PTT.
    - Datatype: <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**hematocrit**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical note:
"LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 12.5, {{**hematocrit**}}
33.8, platelet count 364,000, PT 12.5, PTT 29.7, INR 1.1,
sodium 139, potassium 4.8, chloride 102, CO2 26, BUN 51,
creatinine 2.1, glucose 166, hemoglobin A1C of 7.2.  Wound
cultures of his ankle wound showed pseudomonas which was
pansensitive and staph coag positive which was resistant only
to Penicillin."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**hematocrit**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 12.5, {{**hematocrit**}} 33.8

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**hematocrit**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The hematocrit test is performed on the admission date. 

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**hematocrit**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**hematocrit**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: LABEL. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 2]: Label would be hematocrit.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**hematocrit**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**hematocrit**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. LABEL: hematocrit"

Example 2: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**calcium**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical Note:
"LABORATORY DATA:  Initial labs revealed white count of 10.8,
hematocrit 32.7; PT 11.7, INR 0.9, PTT 26.5; CHEM7 131/5.3,
91/29, 64/8.3, glucose 475; {{**calcium**}} 9.8, magnesium 2.5"

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**calcium**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: LABORATORY DATA:  Initial labs revealed ... {{**calcium**}} 9.8.

**Step 2) Determine the CHARTTIME step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**calcium**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The exact date of 'initial' is difficult to determine, so determining the charttime is not possible. 

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**calcium**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**calcium**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: LABEL. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 2]: Label would be calcium.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**calcium**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**calcium**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. LABEL: calcium"

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Clinical note:
"<<<<CLINICAL_NOTE>>>>"
