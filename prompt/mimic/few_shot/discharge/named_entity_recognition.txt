Objective: Develop a NER system to identify and categorize specific named entities in clinical texts step by step.

Guidelines: Extract entities step by step and classify entity.
- Category 1: Entities Accompanied by Numeric Values
     - Definition: This category includes entities that are mentioned along with specific numeric values. These numbers represent measurable data such as dosages, counts, measurements, etc., providing precise quantifiable information.
     - Example: "The glucose level is 100 mg/dL" or "Administer 200 mg of ibuprofen." In these cases, the numeric values (e.g., glucose level, ibuprofen dosage) are explicitly stated.
- Category 2: Entities Mentioned Without Any Numeric Values
     - Definition: Entities that are discussed in terms of their presence, occurrence, or the fact that they were administered or performed, without providing any numerical or quantitative data, fall into this category.
     - Example: "The patient has been prescribed antibiotics" or "An MRI scan was conducted." Here, no specific dosage of antibiotics or quantitative results from the MRI scan are mentioned.
- Category 3: Entities with Condition-Related Information Excluding Numeric Values
    -Definition: This category captures entities related to state, condition, or outcomes that are described through qualitative assessments or descriptions without the use of explicit numeric data. It may include references to changes in condition or stability, described not with numbers but in descriptive or qualitative terms.
    -Example: "Pt had severe rise in ALT and AST." or "The patient's condition has stabilized." or "Puse was drop." Although these statements imply a change or assessment of condition, they do not provide specific numeric values. Instead, the focus is on qualitative descriptions of change or status, which may inherently rely on an understanding of baseline or previous values for context.
 * Category 3 specifically addresses the portrayal of changes in condition or results through qualitative descriptions. These may indicate changes over time or relative to a previous state, without directly citing numerical values. Even though understanding these changes often requires some knowledge of initial numeric values, the category itself emphasizes descriptive or qualitative assessments rather than explicit numerical data.
