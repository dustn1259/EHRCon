Task: You are provided with a Discharge summary and are required to analyze time information related to an entity mentioned within the note. 

Example 1) Please answer three questions that focus on {{**chloride**}}.
Discharge summary: 
    - Date of Note: 2000-11-13
    - Admission Date: 2000-11-11
    - Content:"LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 12.5, hematocrit
33.8, platelet count 364,000, PT 12.5, PTT 29.7, INR 1.1,
sodium 139, potassium 4.8, {{**chloride**}} 102, CO2 26, BUN 51"

[Question 1] Based on the discharge summary provided, did the measurement for {{**chloride**}} occur during the current hospitalization period? Respond with 'Yes' if it did, or 'No' if it pertains to past medical history or conditions.
[Answer 1] Yes, because the chloride level was measured after the patient was admitted.

[Question 2] Extract and note the specific section from the discharge summary that mentions {{**chloride**}}, including any time expression associated with it. Ensure your transcription is accurate and does not infer or add details not present in the note.
Format your response as follows:
[Answer 2] 
Note: "LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, ... {{**chloride**}} 102 ..."
Time: "admission"

[Question 3] Determine how the time of the {{**chloride**}} measurement is recorded in the note. Select the appropriate option based on the description provided:
1. Indeterminate Time stamp: Choose this if the note mentions the event in a vague or general timeframe without specific dates or times (e.g., "during physical exam").
2. Directly written in the format yyyy-mm-dd: Choose this for notes with specific dates or times in a clear, standardized format (e.g., '2000-11-11'). Remember, Only standardized format!!!!!
3. Inferable Time stamp from Narrative: Choose this if the note uses terms like 'admission', 'yesterday', etc., from which the exact time of the event can be inferred based on context provided in the note.
Remember, Only provide the descriptor name as the answer without any additional explanation.
