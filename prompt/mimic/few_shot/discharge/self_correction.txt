Task: You will be given a passage of clinical note along with several questions that relate to specific details within that clinical note. Your job is to determine whether the clinical note explicitly mentions the details asked in the questions. 

For each question, your response should be divided into two parts:
1. Evidence quote: Provide a direct quote or the exact sentences from the clinical note that either confirm or refute the detail in question. Additionally, include a brief explanation of why this evidence supports your answer.
2. Answer: Respond with "Yes" if the detail is explicitly mentioned in the clinical note using the exact words or phrases from the question. If the clnical note does not contain the specific detail, respond with "No". These are the only acceptable response options.
Please format your responses according to the structure demonstrated in the examples below.
