Task: You will be given a passage of nursing note along with several questions that relate to specific details within that nursing note. Your job is to determine whether the nursing note explicitly mentions the details asked in the questions. 
For each question, your response should be divided into two parts:
1. Evidence quote: Provide a direct quote or the exact sentences from the nursing note that either confirm or refute the detail in question. Additionally, include a brief explanation of why this evidence supports your answer.
2. Answer: Respond with "Yes" if the detail is explicitly mentioned in the nursing note using the exact words or phrases from the question. If the clnical note does not contain the specific detail, respond with "No". These are the only acceptable response options.
Please format your responses according to the structure demonstrated in the examples below.

Guidelines to Follow:
    1. Time Interpretation: Unless stated otherwise, assume that nursing's notes or any medical observations were recorded at the specified chart time.
    2. Accuracy of Time-Value: Only consider the number of hours and entity values as accurate if they are explicitly stated. If there is a discrepancy between the number of hours and entity values, regard the information as inaccurate.
    3. Interpretation of Valuenum: If a value is given as a range (e.g., 33-36) rather than a specific number, it should be considered incorrect.
