Task: The objective is to analyze a clinical note to extract specific details about an indicated Entity, focusing solely on information that is directly stated. Extract and document findings related to this entity without making assumptions about unmentioned details. This involves identifying the time and values associated with this entity and documenting these findings in a structured manner. Adhere to the following instructions for a precise analysis.

Instructions:
1. Carefully examine the clinical note, paying close attention to any instance of the Entity highlighted as {{**Entity**}}. Focus solely on this entity for your analysis.
2. Rely exclusively on the information provided within the clinical note, guided by the instructions and column descriptions provided.
3. Extract and document only the information that directly pertains to the {{**Entity**}}, disregarding all other data.
4. When extracting data, only include information that is explicitly mentioned in the text. Avoid making assumptions or inferring details that are not directly stated. 
5. Each piece of extracted information related to the Entity must be documented in the specified output format in the EHR table, detailed below, with each piece of information in separate rows: 'Mentioned [#]. DRUG: drug, STARTDATE: startdate, ENDDATE: enddate, DOSE_VAL_RX: dose_val_rx, DOSE_UNIT_RX: dose_unit_rx'

Additional Requirements:
1. When the clinical note specifies a range for a measurement (for example, 'entity 1 to 2 p.o'), it indicates that the measurement can fall anywhere within that range. For these instances, you should skip documenting this information entirely in the table; do not fill in any value for DOSE_VAL_RX, and do not create a table row for this range. Simply proceed as if the range mention does not provide a specific enough detail to be included.

Column Descriptions and Schema Information:
1. DRUG: The Drug column lists the name of the medication that was prescribed to the patient.
    - Datatype: <class 'str'>
2. STARTDATE: The Startdate column records the date when a prescribed medication was first ordered or administered to the patient.
    - Datatype:  <class 'datetime'>
3. ENDDATE: The Enddate column records the date when the administration of a prescribed medication was completed or discontinued.
    - Datatype: <class 'datetime'>
4. DOSE_VAL_RX: The Dose_val_rx column specifies the numeric value of the prescribed dose for the medication.
    - Datatype:  <class 'float'>
5. DOSE_UNIT_RX: The Dose_unit_rx column specifies the unit of measurement for the prescribed dose of the medication, such as milligrams (mg) or milliliters (mL).
    - Datatype:  <class 'str'>

Example 1: Analyze the nursing note to extract {{**Toprol XL**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Nursing note:
"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed in 2018 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed in 2018.
Assessment:Vital signs: BP 145/90 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min, Temp 98.6Â°F.
Patient reports mild headache.
Action:
Administered {{**Toprol XL**}} 50 mg p.o. q.d for blood pressure control."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Toprol XL**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: Administered {{**Toprol XL**}} 50 mg p.o. q.d for blood pressure control."

**Step 2) Determine the STARTDATE and ENDDATE step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Toprol XL**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The STARTDATE for the administration of {{Toprol XL}} is 'charttime', reflecting the immediate care documented in the nursing note, with no ENDDATE specified due to the lack of explicit mention. 

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Toprol XL**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Toprol XL**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: DRUG, STARTDATE, ENDDATE, DOSE_VAL_RX, DOSE_UNIT_RX. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: As referred to in the answer from step 2, the drug is Toprol XL. The starttime should be at charttime, and the endtime would be NaN. The valuenum should be 50, and the dose_val_rx should be in mg.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Toprol XL**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Toprol XL**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. DRUG: Toprol XL, STARTDATE: charttime, ENDDATE: NaN, DOSE_VAL_RX: 50, DOSE_UNIT_RX: mg"

Example 2: Analyze the nursing note to extract {{**Lasix**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.

Nursing note:
" Response:
   Pt resting comfortably since ativan dose given. Appears less anxious
   and requesting that her son [**Name (NI) **] stay at bedside while she rests. Less
   requests for suctioning and using tonsil tip suction for managing her
   oral secretions and received  160 mg of {{**Lasix**}}."

**Step 1) Identify and Extract Information about '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text.
[Answer in step 1]: received  160 mg of {{**Lasix**}}

**Step 2) Determine the STARTDATE and ENDDATE step-by-step: Identify when the '{{**Lasix**}}' occurs.**
[Answer in step 2]: The STARTDATE for the administration of {{Lasix}} is 'charttime', reflecting the immediate care documented in the nursing note, with no ENDDATE specified due to the lack of explicit mention. 

**Step 3) Fill the table with information Directly Related to '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text.**
Based on the mentions of '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text found in Step 1 and Step 2, fill in the table with these column headers: DRUG, STARTDATE, ENDDATE, DOSE_VAL_RX, DOSE_UNIT_RX. If specific details are not mentioned in the clinical note, record it as 'NaN'.
[Answer in step 3]: The drug is Lasix, with 'dose_val_rx' being 160 and 'dose_unit_rx' being mg. According to the answer in step 2, startdate would be charttime and enddate would be nan.

**Step 4) Summarize and Present Your Findings Directly Related to '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text in Detailed Rows**
For each piece of information directly related to '{{**Lasix**}}' in the given text, compile your findings into separate rows using the format below:
- "Mentioned [1]. DRUG: Lasix, STARTDATE: charttime, ENDDATE: NaN, DOSE_VAL_RX: 160, DOSE_UNIT_RX: mg"

Your Task: Analyze the clinical note to extract {{**<<<ENTITY>>>**}} data and document the findings in the EHR table.
